# Why?

Meme calendars are a dying art. 

I chalk it up to the dead internet theory, and I want to help try take back some of the pre-2016 internet culture. For this blog, I'll mainly be focusing on reddit.

I have no clue how long I'll be able to keep this up, but I'll try to remember updating this post every month till December 2025. If I suddenly stop, It means I got a job.
