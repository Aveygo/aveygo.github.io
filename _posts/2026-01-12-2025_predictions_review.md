description: A review of the my predictions that I made in January 2025.
---

381 days ago, I [posted]({% link _posts/2025-02-01-2025_predictions.md %}) my predictions for the year. Now that the dust of 2025 has settled, I'll be reviewing my work and closing off this experiment.

# Prediction 1: Silicon Crisis

>  NVIDIA stock price increases by 20% ($120) due to unprecedented demand of Silicon Chips

I don't think I could've asked for a better prediction. NVIDIA stock has risen 40% since my prediction, and there is currently a massive 'ram shortage' that is effecting global trade.

# Prediction 2: Video Generation Golden Era

> A popular movie (>$100 budget) comes out with AI generated scenes / actors as a selling point

This prediction was more of a miss than I would like. There was certainly some interesting developments with the release of Sora 2, Veo 3, and Runway Gen-4.5, but it was not as impactful as I originally thought. Alternatively, I was surprisingly accurate with my prediction that a model analogous to DeepSeek would be developed, which would of course be the famous Wan2.2 by Alibaba.

# Prediction 3: StarLink Competitor

> A company launches more than 50 satellites for communication purposes

This one was also spot on. Amazon Leo launched 180 production satellites, with a full rollout expected this year.

# Prediction 4: Strong Australia / US Alliance

> 90% chance that the United States does not drop AUSFTA

I was also right about this prediction, but only partially. While the US didn't drop AUSFTA, they did put a 10% tariff (the minimum amount) on Australian exports. Despite this, I feel like my prediction is more than valid as trade actually managed to increase by 20% year-on-year despite the additional taxes.

# Wild Cards

> **Netflix incorporates AI upscaling features**

Netflix infamously upscaled older classics such as the 1980s sitcom *A Different World*.

> **Quantum computers are 'miniaturized' (still *very* expensive)**

Somewhat true. There were multiple advancements made in 2025, but not as extensive as I hoped.

> **Bitcoin reaches at least 120k**

Bitcoin reached an ATH of 125k (then dropped quickly back).

> **OpenAI progression slows / encounters legal troubles**

This is only somewhat true. OpenAI did have some recent controversy with implementing ads into ChatGPT (as well as some infamous lawsuits), but they also released GPT-5/Sora 2 and are generally doing better than the prediction was hoping for.

> **Hard British recession**

This one was a hard miss. Briton was the 3rd fastest growing in terms of GPD in the G7, and the unemployment rate has remained steady (although increasing)

> **Artemis II succeeds primary mission objectives, but is delayed**

Artemis II **was** delayed, although for a *lot* longer than I predicted.

> **Germany leaves the EU**

This one was also a miss, fortunately.

# Conclusion

I think I did reasonably well on my predictions all things considered. I think I generally played it safe but was otherwise almost spot on for most of them. I rate myself 8/10 for my main predictions, and 5/10 for my wildcards.
