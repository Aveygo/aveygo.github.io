This is my first blog post, and hopefully the start of many. 

I created it because I find myself doing really difficult things such as working with nix or compiling for the kindle, and these sorts of things tend to be un-googleable or at best melt ChatGPT's brain. However, when I do find a solution (maybe I brain it out or I find some obsure forum post), it's 50/50 whether or not I document it in my repos on github because most of the time there's not really an opportunity to share.

So I hope that my stuggles can help you on your projects and to help fill in the missing gaps. I also might post some opinions or interesting news articles (maybe some comics?). I mainly aim for my blog to be kind've like an open diary for self-progression and \*personality\*.

Take care, and be sure to checkout my [github](https://github.com/Aveygo) to explore my projects if you are interested.
